## Question 1: Player Experience (9 marks)

Based on the ten kinds of player experience described in lectures, name **two** kinds of experience that could be expected to arise in each of the following games. Give a one-sentence justification for each experience type named.

1.  An online puzzle game, such as [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) or [Sudoku](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku).
2.  A survival horror game, such as [Five Nights at Freddy’s](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/Five_Nights_at_Freddys/) or [Dead Space](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/).
3.  A role-playing game, such as [Baldur’s Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/) or [Cyberpunk 2077](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/).

## Question 2: Player Motivation (6 marks)

A sandbox game such as [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) supports several different player motivations. Using concepts from the Self Determination Theory (SDT) and Player Experience of Needs Satisfaction (PENS) models described in lectures,, identify the key motivation for each of the following three model players  and how it is likely to be satisfied through their play (write one sentence for each):

1.  A player who enjoys socialising with friends on a multiplayer server.
2.  A player who enjoys speedrunning the game to beat the final boss as quickly as possible.
3.  A player who enjoys building beautiful architecture.

## Question 3: Accessibility (6 marks)

Challenge-focused videogames such as [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/) can often exclude players who have different accessibility requirements, such as older players with slower reaction times. For these players Celeste provides an [Assist Mode](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Assist_Mode) which includes options such as: lowering the game speed, infinite stamina, dash assist, invincibility, and chapter skipping.

Consider a model player with slow reaction time due to age or disability. How might Assist Mode allow Celeste to fulfil each of the player’s basic psychological needs (as identified by Self Determination Theory)? Write 1-2 sentences addressing each.

## Question 4 Game Analysis (29 marks)

Consider the game Tetris playable here: [https://tetris.com/play-tetris](https://tetris.com/play-tetris).

Spend some time playing this game and familiarising yourself with how it works, before answering the following questions. (Note: there are many versions and clones of Tetris. These questions specifically relate to the version linked above.)

1.  List the three components of the MDA model. Using Tetris as an example, identify and describe each component. \[6 marks\]
2.  In detail, describe the core mechanics that define the movement of a single block, including how it responds to player input. \[5 marks\]
3.  What goals does the game set for the player (explicitly or implicitly) to motivate play? \[2 marks\]
4.  What is the overall dramatic arc of the game? Identify two ways in which this is created. \[4 marks\]
5.  In this version of Tetris, the play space is 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks tall.
    
    In 2-3 sentences, discuss how the experience of the game would change if:
    1.  You doubled the height of the space (i.e. 10 by 40). \[2 marks\]
    2.  You doubled the width of the space (i.e. 20 by 20). \[2 marks\]
    
    Assume none of the other game mechanics or parameters are changed.

  Watch [this video](https://echo360.net.au/media/70fbe4e8-ffdc-4e6b-b338-fc10f953b4ff/public) showing a play through of the game by an intermediate player.
  
  The video displays a game dynamic in which the player has used the ‘Hold’ mechanic multiple times (e.g. at timetamps 1:05, 1:37, and 2:05) to hold onto a particular block and then release it later in the game. 

6.  What game mechanics motivate this dynamic? \[3 marks\]
7.  What kind of player experience does this dynamic create? \[2 marks\]

   Towards the end of the video (from 7:54 onwards) the player's behaviour changes, leading to a dramatic change at 10:17.

8. Using flow theory, offer an explanation of this change in behaviour. What can you infer about the player's experience? \[3 marks\]
